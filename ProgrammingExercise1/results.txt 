The following estimates:

Shared-birthday probability for M=10.

sharedProb=0.118500

What is the least value of M for which the shared-birthday probability is larger than 0.5?

The least value of M for which the consecutive-birthdays probability is larger than 0.5 is 21.

The consecutive-birthdays probability for M=10 and K=3.

consecProb=0.033300

With K=3, what is the least value of M for which the consecutive-birthdays probability is larger than 0.5?

The least value of M for which the consecutive birthdays probability is larger than 0.5 is 3.


Put these numbers (manually) in a plain text file called results.txt in your directory. For each estimate, use at least 10,000 trials of the experiment.
